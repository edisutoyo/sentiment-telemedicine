# Replication Package of Enhancing Telemedicine Service Quality through Sentiment Analysis of User Reviews in Indonesia: A Deep Learning Approach with Imbalanced Data Handling

## Description of this study:
Sentiment analysis, a branch of natural language processing, linguistic computing, and text mining, is used to assess user opinions and product ratings. In this study, sentiment analysis is applied to evaluate user sentiments regarding telemedicine services in Indonesia, identifying both positive and negative feedback. Given the high volume of user reviews, manually reading each review is inefficient, and considering only a subset may lead to biased conclusions. Therefore, an automated approach is necessary to accurately classify sentiments. This study employs multiple deep learning architectures, including SRNN, 1D-CNN, 1L-LSTM, and BiLSTM, to classify user reviews on telemedicine applications. However, the dataset is highly imbalanced, with a ratio exceeding 1:14. To address this, an EDA-based oversampling technique is proposed. Experimental results indicate that EDA-based oversampling outperforms other resampling techniques such as random undersampling, random oversampling, and SMOTE, achieving superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, positive and negative sentiment word clouds offer valuable insights for stakeholders aiming to improve service quality. Analyzing both positive and negative user sentiments enables telemedicine providers to enhance user experience and reduce barriers to telemedicine adoption.
